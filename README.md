# Laravel Testing
This repository stores my testing with Laravel, Tailwind CSS, React, and SCSS. While I've already made production-ready Laravel projects such as [Best Mods](https://bestmods.io/), I am still very new to all of these frameworks and libraries. Therefore, I do like performing testing knowing if I break something, it won't be the end of the world, lol.

## Test-Web01
This project includes Tailwind CSS and React using the [Infinite Scroller NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroller). We demonstrate how to continously load static data from an array. The source file where most of this performed may be found [here](https://github.com/gamemann/Laravel-Testing/blob/master/test-web01/resources/js/components/test.jsx)!

We will be implementing this functionality (both React and the Infinite Scroller package) into [Best Mods](https://bestmods.io) instead of relying on jQuery library called [DataTables](https://datatables.net/).
